# Architecture Comparison Animations

This directory will contain side-by-side comparisons between traditional component-based architectures and Trinity's unified approach.

Expected animations:
- Component-based vs unified processing
- Performance difference visualizations
- Architectural paradigm shift demonstrations

Placeholder file to maintain directory structure.
